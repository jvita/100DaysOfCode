The goal of this day's challenge will be to take in webcam footage and do some
basic image processing on it.

A fun extension to this (probably not possible in one day) would be to try to
draw a picture using my finger via webcam feed

Starter code from a Stackoverflow post:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2601194/displaying-a-webcam-feed-using-opencv-and-python/11449901#11449901

Unfortunately, this day was basically just spent installing OpenCV...
